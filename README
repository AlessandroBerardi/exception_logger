ExceptionLogger
===============

The Exception Logger (forgive the horrible name) logs your Rails exceptions in the database and provides a funky web interface to manage them.

First you need to generate the migration:

  ./script/generate exception_migration

After that, visit /logged_exceptions in your application to manage the exceptions.
